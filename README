## What is an Internet Archive Item?

An **Internet Archive item** is a single entry in the Internet Archive's collection, representing a specific piece of content such as books, software, music, movies, or more. Each item has associated metadata and content files, which can be accessed via the Internet Archive website.

For example, an item might include:
- Text files, such as scanned books.
- Media files, such as MP3s or MP4s.
- Software files, such as disk images.

Each item is uniquely identified by a slug in its URL (e.g., `https://archive.org/details/[identifier]`), and the `*_files.xml` file provides a list of all files associated with that item.

## Requirements

- **PHP** installed on your system.
- Windows operating system.
- Command-line access.
- `curl.exe` and its associated files included in the script directory:
  - `curl-ca-bundle.crt`
  - `libcurl-x64.def`
  - `libcurl-x64.dll`

## Installation

1. Download the `dlarchive.php` script and place it in a directory of your choice.
2. Ensure the following files are in the same directory as the script:
   - `curl.exe`
   - `curl-ca-bundle.crt`
   - `libcurl-x64.def`
   - `libcurl-x64.dll`

## Usage

Run the script from the Windows command line as follows:

```bash
php dlarchive.php [directory_path] [url_to_files.xml]
```

### Parameters
- **`[directory_path]`**: The path to the directory where the downloaded files will be saved. This must be a valid path on your system.
- **`[url_to_files.xml]`**: The URL to the `*_files.xml` file of the desired Internet Archive item. This file contains a list of all downloadable files in the item.

### Finding the XML File
An item's XML file can be found by browsing to the desired item on archive.org. Under "Download Options" on the right side of the page, click "SHOW ALL." Then find the file that ends in `_files.xml`.

### Example

```bash
php dlarchive.php "C:\Downloads\ArchiveFiles" "https://archive.org/download/example_item/example_item_files.xml"
```
